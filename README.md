This app was made by Ben Stearns, an IT student at Northeast Community College - Norfolk, NE. The purpose of this app is to allow the user to track the achievements/trophies a player earns while playing 
their video game titles. The app initially starts blank to allow the user to enter all the information they need for tracking purposes. The first form, Game Selection, allows the user to select a game 
they wish to work with. To add a game to the list in this form, use the [Add Game] button to display an entry form to add a game title to the list. Once a game is added, select the game you wish to work
with from the list and click the [View Achievements] button. This displays a new form called the Achievements form. This form also starts blank to allow the user to add the specific achievements unique 
to that game title using the [Add Achievements] button. This form also utiliizes a checklist to mark the achievements as complete as the player earns them. All information is saved to a text file unless 
the [Delete] buttons are used. Happy playing!
